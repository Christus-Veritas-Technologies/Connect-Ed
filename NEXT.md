Add a beautiful., on-theme (with correct Connect-Ed copy) welcome message for those signing into the mobile app for the first time

And then when the user first enters the app, always aredircet them to a page called app/loading

That page shows loading state with app copy, app logo, theme colors but under the hood, it decices where to rediret the user pbased on auth state, whether it's their fiorsttime (redircet them to the onbaording, and other cases as well

Have different onboardings for each user, with a minimu of 4 and a max of 5 steps, okay ?
